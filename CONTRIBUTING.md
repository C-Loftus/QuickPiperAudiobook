# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing. I am happy to accept contributions.

The best ways you can contribute are:

1. Sharing this program with others 
2. Translating the readme or writing tutorials for your native language

## Scope

For the time being this program is focused on using Piper exclusively. I am not opposed to adding other models in the future, but I have not seen any other models that are better than Piper in the following aspects:

1. Ability to generate long audiobooks in a reasonable amount of time without a GPU
2. Support for many languages
3. Reasonable to install locally without Docker
4. Relatively natural voice quality

If you have a model that is better than Piper and fulfills multiple of these criteria, please let me know.

## Help

I am happy to provide guidance or mentorship to potential contributors.
