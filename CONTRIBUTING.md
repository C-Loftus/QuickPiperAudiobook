# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing. I am happy to accept contributions.

The easiest ways to contribute are:

1. Sharing this program with others 
2. Translating the readme or writing tutorials for your native language
3. Submitting a PR for one of the issues tagged `Help wanted` or `Good first issue`
    - If you do submit code, please make sure there are associated tests 
    - If you are interested in contributing code, feel free to ping me and I am happy to provide guidance or mentorship.

This program originally arose out of a desire to create audiobooks easily to help those with eyestrain. I am not opposed to adding other models, but it is important that they can:

1. Generate long audiobooks in a reasonable amount of time without a GPU
2. Support many languages
3. Output relatively natural voice quality
4. Install locally without Docker or lots of dependencies

If you have a model that is better than Piper and fulfills multiple of these criteria, please let me know.
