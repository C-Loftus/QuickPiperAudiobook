# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing. I am happy to accept contributions.

The easiest ways to contribute are:

1. Sharing this program with others 
2. Translating the readme or writing tutorials for your native language

If you are interested in contributing code, feel free to ping me and I am happy to provide guidance or mentorship.

For the time being this program is focused on using Piper exclusively. I am not opposed to adding other models and generalizing this program further in the future, but I have not seen any other models that are better than Piper in the following aspects:

1. Ability to generate long audiobooks in a reasonable amount of time without a GPU
2. Support for many languages
3. Relatively natural voice quality
4. Reasonable to install locally without Docker/lots of dependencies

If you have a model that is better than Piper and fulfills multiple of these criteria, please let me know.
