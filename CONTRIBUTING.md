# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing. I am happy to accept contributions.

The best ways you can contribute are:

1. Sharing this program with others 
2. Translating the readme or writing tutorials for your native language

## Scope

For the time being this program is focused on using Piper exclusively. I am not opposed to adding other models in the future, but I have not seen any other models that are better than Piper in the following aspects:

1. Ability to generate long audiobooks in a reasonable amount of time without a GPU
2. Support for many languages
3. Reasonable to install without Docker
4. Sounds relatively natural
